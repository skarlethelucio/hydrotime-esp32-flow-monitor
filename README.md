# Hidrotime - ESP32 Water Monitoring System

ESP32-based water monitoring system designed for real-time measurement and leak detection.

---

Hidrotime is an IoT system designed to monitor water levels and flow in a tank using an ESP32 and sensors.

The system not only provides real-time data through a REST API, but is also designed to help detect abnormal water consumption patterns, enabling early leak detection and improving water efficiency.
